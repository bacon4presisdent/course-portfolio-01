        <h1>Top 5 Futurama Characters</h1>
    <main>
        <ol>
            <li><h2>Fry</h2></li>
            <p>Philip J. Fry is the main character of Futurama - a relatable everyman.</p>
            <li><h2>Leela</h2></li>
            <p>A capable pilot with fierce loyalty, Leela keeps the crew reigned in.</p>
            <li><h2>Bender</h2></li>
            <p>Whenever the team's spirits are low, Bender is sure to step in and give a swift kick. Honestly, it's basically charity.</p>
            <li><h2>Nibbler</h2></li>
            <p>Nibbler is an adorable fuzzball with an appetite for trouble, and the fangs to match.</p>
            <li><h2>Roberto</h2></li>
            <p>Whether he was built to be crazy, or just lucky enough to end up that way, Roberto is a robot to watch out for. Incidentally, you might want to hide your watch.</p>
        </ol>
