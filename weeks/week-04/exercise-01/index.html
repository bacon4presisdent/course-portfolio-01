        <h1>My Dev Tools Improvements</h1>
        <p>
            I used Brave's developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" a
            website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="./dev-tools-public-relations.png" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I improved" />
        </div>
        <h2>What I Improved</h2>
        <p>
            I chose to make some minor changes to the appearance of the whitehouse.gov website. 
            About halfway down the homepage is a box titled "Our Priorities". Originally, the paragraph 
            spoke of actual policy topics. I edited the textbox to have fake, lighthearted aims.
            I also updated the font-family to "fantasy". I was trying to use a specific font called Luminari,
            but was unable to select it, possibly being overriden by a class variable.
