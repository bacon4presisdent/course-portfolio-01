            Howdy! I grew up playing videogames. Ranging from PlayStation 2 to a custom desktop PC, 
            gaming was, for a long time, what I looked forward to after school or work.
            This webpage showcases my most played games on the Steam platform, by hours played.
            Each card also features the Steam Store game description, user ratings, and publisher.

                <h2>Rimworld</h2>
                <p class="details">Playtime: 1,018.1 hours</p>
                <p class="description">
                   Rimworld may have a funny name and cartoony graphics, but it is renowned
                   for having a deep gameplay loop. Community-created mods add an immense 
                   amount of variety and flavor.

                <h2>Dwarf Fortress</h2>
                <p class="details">Playtime: 575.8 hours</p>
                <p class="description">
                    Dwarf Fortress (lovingly known as DF) has been around, in one form or another, since 2002. 
                    Originally it used ASCII graphics, but has since been updated with 
                    pixellated sprites. Described as a "world simulation", DF overtakes Rimworld in complexity of gameplay mechanics;
                    this has the downside of discouraging new players, but don't expect to
                    master everything on your first playthrough. "And remember, losing is fun."

                <p class="details">Playtime: 419 hours </p>
                <p class="description">
                    Super Earth - our home. Prosperity. Liberty. Democracy - our way of life. This is the intro for a legendary game.
                    Helldivers 2 was a sensation when it released in February of 2024. You play as an expendable space-borne infantry trooper
                    in a fight for the survival of a united Earth, called Super Earth. The vibe is sort of a "parody but serious" version of the Starship Troopers movie.

                <p class="details">Playtime: 291.7 hours</p>
                <p class="description">
                    A medieval swordfighting game, this masterpiece pits armies of fictional medieval-era kingdoms against each other
                    in large scale battles. If you've ever heard of the game "For Honor",
                    Chivalry 2 is like that, but fun.
